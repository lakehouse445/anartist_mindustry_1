# Mindustry Ultra-Tech Mod Megalist

## Materials

1. **Metabronze**: A tough, easy to work with metal. It’s sturdiness and simplicity makes it a good material for everything.

   - Flammability: 0%
   - Radioactivity: 0%
   - Charge: 0%

2. **Platinum**: Strong and flexible metal with good use as physical support.
   - Explosiveness: 0%
   - Flammability: 0%
   - Radioactivity: 0%
   - Charge: 0%

3. **Sterling Clay**: Soft like sand, but sparkles like crystal. Useless on it’s own, but perhaps contains something useful.
   - Explosiveness: 0%
   - Flammability: 0%
   - Radioactivity: 0%
   - Charge: 0%

4. **Cerebrick**: An extremely hard, very heat-resistant ceramic. It sparkles under direct sunlight.

## Sniper Towers

- Sniper towers increase the range of a turret depending on the tier of the tower.

- Another tower concept uses Thorium or Asmoradium (a majorly unstable radioactive element crafted in the mod) to create massive radiation attacks that resemble beams of computer static. The beam lingers and has individual little attacks inside it that move slower and hit later. 

- The attacks progress from a small radio flash tower, to a pulse tower, and finally to a massive laser beam.

- The highest tier of base in the mod is the Skytower Elevator. It is a 12x12 structure that links together and shares materials with your whole planet. It cannot be launched directly, but can be upgraded to. 

## Underwater Materials and Sifters

- The mod also introduces underwater materials.

- Sifters are added, which are super slow but produce the most powerful materials. 

- Gold can be sifted from the bottom of lakes along with a few other materials.
